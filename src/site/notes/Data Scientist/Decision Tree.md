Decision Tree algorithms are a type of probability tree-like structural model that continuously separates data in order to categorize or make predictions depending on the results of the previous set of questions. The model analyzes the data and provides responses to the questions in order to assist you in making more informed choices.

You could, for instance, utilize a decision tree in which the answers Yes or No are used to select a certain species of bird based on data elements like the bird's feathers, its ability to fly or swim, the sort of beak it has, and so on.^[https://www.datacamp.com/blog/supervised-machine-learning]


**PROS**|**CONS**

Very intuitive and easy to explain | Instable - changes in training data can cause huge differences in prediction
Don't require a lot of data preparation | Prone to overfitting
